Quickly Create Professional Documentation
Help+Manual is as easy to use as a word processor, yet much more powerful.
It helps you to easily create documentation that can be accessed by everyone in your organization.
 
Import Content from Word, HTML and Other Formats
Migrate your legacy content from Microsoft® Word, Adobe® RoboHelp®, Author-It®, HTML and Winhelp with precise control. Plus, Help+Manual can import, build and update source code documentation from Visual Studio.
 
	Microsoft® Word
Transform legacy Word documents into responsive Webhelp, HTML Help or eBooks. The import wizard offers detailed control how the Word structures are split.
	HTML Files
The HTML import tool reads almost every HTML file and complete folders, building a table of contents of the source folder structure.
	Windows HTML Help (.chm)
Import compiled CHM files including formatted HTML pages, images, keywords structures, table of contents, help context numbers and associative keywords.
	Winhelp Sources (.hpj)
Convert an old Winhelp project file to standard HTML Help. Text formatting, images, keywords, table of contents and help context numbers are perfectly converted.
	Compiled Winhelp (.hlp)
If the Winhelp source files are no longer available, Help+Manual will read and import compiled HLP files as well.
	Adobe® RoboHelp®
Transform RoboHelp® projects into a modern and sophisticated help system.
	Author-It®
Import Author-It® XML sources including text, structure, images, styles, text conditions, keywords and help context mappings. Your Author-It® version needs to be able to output XML for this task.
	Visual Studio Source Documentation
Build a help skeleton from your Visual Studio source code and extract code comments and internal documentation. Complete the source code documentation with Help+Manual and publish all formats that Help+Manual supports.
The help project built from VS sources can be updated later on, when unit structures, functions and objects have changed.

Power Features for Power Users
Help+Manual is much more than a help authoring and documentation software, it is a full suite of tools. Everything you need is right where you need it.
	Teamwork and multi-user editing? Check!
	Integrated Version Control? Check!
	Translation management? Check!
	Image tools and project management? Double Check!
 
Built-in PDF engine
Help+Manual comes with a state-of-the-art PDF engine that is built in. You do not need any additional tools to create Adobe PDF manuals. Just press the Publish button.
Concurrent multi-user editing
Help+Manual is the only tool on the market that offers concurrent multi-user editing out of the box, no special database required. In other words, two or more authors can work on the same help project simultaneously.
Help+Manual is pure XML
Help+Manual is a true WYSIWYG XML editor that doesn't require any knowledge of XML or XML coding skills. You work as you would in a familiar word processor like Word, but you also have full access to the XML source if necessary.
Furthermore, the XML source format can be edited with any XML editor. XML is an open industry standard.
Single source, multiple outputs
Single source is much more than publishing the same content to different formats. Help+Manual supports conditional and customized output features that enable you to include variant content versions for different output formats and purposes – all in the same project, no post-processing is required.
Help+Manual handles all the complexities of help formatting and generation for you, letting you concentrate on the work of writing. But there is also extensive support for power users and experienced help authors. You can get under the hood and insert your own HTML code, change the code the program uses to generate your projects, manipulate topic and project templates and more. Help+Manual gives you the best of both worlds.

Expand the Details section in a publication record to find the catalog numbers or products covered in the publication, as well as the revision history.
Find information on a range of products
On the results page, click the product category and select General Information to find publications about multiple product lines. For example, all Connection Systems.
Find a certificate, such as a Declaration of Conformity
Search by product and type of certification, such as ATEX. Then select the Certificate publication type. Or go to our Product Certifications page to search by type of certification.
Find a publication in another language
Use the language pull-down on the results page to view which publications are available in that language. Or, from the publication record, use the language pull-down next to the download icon. Choose from the available languages to download the publication in a different language.
Find publications that are tailored to your application
Combine search and filters to find publications that are tailored to your application. For example, search for ControlLogix, then select an industry, such as Automotive. Also, you can filter on Services or Solutions.
